# MyButton - Arduino Library
An Arduino library to easily manage button presses, supporting:
- Single click  
- Double click  
- Long press
A handy utility for user interaction with just a single button.

## Description
MyButton is a lightweight Arduino library designed to simplify input handling from digital push buttons.  
It helps detect common button actions such as **short clicks**, **double clicks**, and **long presses**, using **non-blocking logic**.

You can find example usage and setup in the `examples/` folder of the library.

## Dependencies

None. This library  doesnt need anything.
